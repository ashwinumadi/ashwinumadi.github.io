I am Ashwin Umadi, 2nd year research based Computer Science masters student at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado Boulder</a>. Currently, I am conducting my research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) under the guidance of <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/maria-l-pacheco">Maria L Pacheco</a>. I have 2+ years of expertise in Full Stack Development, Computer Networks, Telecom domain(4G & 5G), Dockers and Kubernetes. Adding on, I have 2 published research works in the realm of Deep Learning.

I have completed by undergraduate degree from PES Univeristy, Bangalore, India in Electronics and Communication engineering, where I worked predominantly worked on Computer Vision and Generative AI under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qgLnGD8AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr Koshy George</a> and <a href="https://staff.pes.edu/nm1042/">Dr Niranjana Krupa</a>. In my final year, I interned at <a href="https://www.sandvine.com/">Sandvine Technologies</a>, where I continued to work for over two years post-graduation. At Sandvine Technologies, I played a key role in designing and improving a Full-stack website for predicting server load analysis in customer Use Cases. Additionally, I developed statistical modeling algorithms to predict CPU load for specific Use Cases.

With experience across diverse domains I assertively express myself as a tech aficionado. My drive lies in introducing inventive problem-solving concepts to address tangible real-world obstacles. Presently in search of a professional environment where I can apply the proficiencies I've cultivated to tackle pioneering challenges, and in turn, continue nurturing my abilities as I progress along this journey.
