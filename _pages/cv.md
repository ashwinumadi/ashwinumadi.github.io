Education
=======
* M.S. in Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder, USA, 2025
* B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering, PES University, India, 2021

Work experience
======
* Senior Software Engineer: Sandvine Technologies : Apr 2023 - July 2023
  * Optimized Sandvine’s network products’ prediction tool website page response time by 25% by improving the backend algorithm performance from quadratic to linear time through dynamic programming and caching data. [Python Django ORM, Git]
  * Built an automated testing framework for more than 50 features integrated in the prediction tool website reducing two days of manpower needed on a monthly basis. Enhanced the existing unit tests and functional tests to cover up to 80% of the codebase.
  * Led the technical staff for customer related issues in the enterprise solutions for all Sandvine’s 4G and 5G control plane products.

* Software Engineer: Sandvine Technologies : Oct 2022 - Mar 2023
  * Analyzed and managed production services (using Kubernetes and Docker) for the prediction website tool. This was used by all
of Sandvine’s customers during their onboarding process including the leading telecommunication companies.
  * Gained excellence in data modeling, improved accuracy of regression models from 90% to 98% by optimizing the model
hyperparameters. These were used to train data models to predict total Sandvine’s telecom products. Training involved complex
datasets with more than 10 varying parameters on average. [Python, Statistical modeling, Matplotlib, Git]
  * Developed a Deep Learning model to reduce time spent in data modeling from 3 days to under 30 minutes, leading to a
significant enhancement in feature delivery from 6 to 10 features per month. Also, served as the Scrum master for the team.
  * Developed and documented around 10 new features within the categories of ‘Ease of Usability’, ‘Adaptability to Multiple
Configuration', and ‘Performance Improvement’ for both frontend and backend sections of the application.

* Test Engineer: Sandvine Technologies : Jun 2021 - Sept 2022
  * Enhanced and maintained a Django-based web application (utilizing Postgres for DB, Vue.js, Javascript, and Node.js for dynamic UI) predicting Sandvine products for specific customer use cases. Generated detailed PDF reports of these predictions and increased code coverage from 40% to 60% through rigorous unit testing.
  * Analyzed complex system performance data at Sandvine, employing data modeling to predict customer’s telecom product needs with 90% accuracy. Also dealt with data collection, preprocessing and evaluation. [Python, Ordinary Least Square Solution]
