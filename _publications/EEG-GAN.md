title: "Pictorial Information Retrieval from EEG using Generative Adversarial Networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/EEG-GAN
excerpt: 'Presented a supervised methodology to reconstruct images of various shapes and colors as seen by a person from brain signals.

Generative AI and Computer Vision research, using an Emotive Enobio headset to obtain the EEG signals from the brain, and
extracted the features using a CNN model. Finally, reconstructed these signals into images using conditional Deep Convolutional
Generative Adversarial Networks(cDCGAN) models with an inception score of 12.67 (accuracy close to State of the Art models).

Received the Best paper award in the International Conference on Intelligent Informatics and Biomedical Sciences, Japan 2022.'
