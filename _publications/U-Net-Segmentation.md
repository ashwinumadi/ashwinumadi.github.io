title: "Automated Segmentation of Overlapping Cells in Cervical Cytology Images Using Deep Learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/U-Net-Segmentation
excerpt: 'Led the team of three and proposed a novel three stage approach for cell mass, nuclei and cytoplasm segmentation for
overlapping cervical cells via Computer Vision techniques, involving a supervised Machine learning U-net Convolutional Neural
Network. Training criterions used were Binary cross entropy loss function, Adam optimizer.

First stage was Cell Mask segmentation, second Nuclei segmentation, and third stage included sending the previously segmented
images as inputs along with each Cellâ€™s cytoplasm into the U-Net model to obtain the contours of all overlapping cells.

Achieved mean IoU metric of 90%, overperforming the contemporary state of the art techniques. The system was deployed on
Google Colab GPUs to speed up the learning process.'
